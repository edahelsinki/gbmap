# GBMAP (Gradient Boosting Mapping)
Gradient Boosting Mapping is and nonlinear dimensionality reduction and feature creation method. This repository contains the Python code for GBMAP and the experiments in the paper:

> Accepted to Discovery Science 2024, meanwhile check out a previous preprint http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08486.

## Data
Most of the datasets are from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) and will be downloaded as needed, but GeckoQ has to be downloaded separately.

The GeckoQ data can be downloaded from [Fairdata repository](https://doi.org/10.23729/022475cc-e527-41a9-bbc0-0113923cf04c)
Head to the Fairdata repository (link above) and download the `Dataframe.csv` and place it to `experiments/data`.


## Instructions for installing and running the experiments
Script `run.sh` contains explicit instructions how to install and run the experiments. The results for the experiments are placed to `experiments/results` and figures to `experiments/figures`.
